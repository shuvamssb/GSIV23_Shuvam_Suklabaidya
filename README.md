# Movie App Challenge - README

## Instructions

To run and test the Movie App code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:3000
6. You can interact with the app by browsing the list of movies, searching for movies, and viewing their details.

## Proficiency Elements

- **Responsive Design:** The app's layout and components are designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on different screen sizes and devices. This showcases my proficiency in creating user interfaces that adapt seamlessly to various devices.

- **API Integration:** The app integrates with the TMDB API to fetch and display movie data. This demonstrates my ability to work with external APIs, handle asynchronous operations, and manage data within a React application.

- **Infinite Scroll:** The movie list employs infinite scrolling, loading more movies as the user scrolls down. This feature demonstrates my knowledge of handling dynamic content loading and improving user experience.

## Future Improvements

If I had four more hours available, here's what I would do to improve the solution:

1. **Unit Testing:** Implement unit tests using a testing library like Jest and Enzyme to ensure the functionality of components and user interactions.

2. **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling by displaying user-friendly error messages when API requests fail or other unexpected errors occur.

3. **Pagination:** Implement a pagination mechanism to replace infinite scrolling. This would provide users with better control over navigating through large lists of movies.

4. **UI Enhancements:** Improve the overall visual appeal of the app by adding more styling and animations to enhance user engagement.

5. **Refactoring:** Refactor code to improve readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns between components and styles.

## Feedback

Overall, the challenge was a great way to showcase my skills and learn new concepts. The instructions were clear, and the project's requirements were well-defined. Adding a more detailed user story or scenario might help applicants understand the context and user expectations better.

For the app itself, providing additional information about the movies, such as genres and release dates, could enhance the user experience. Additionally, allowing users to mark movies as favorites or add them to a watchlist could make the app more interactive and engaging.
